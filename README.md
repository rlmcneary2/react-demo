# react-demo
Demo React and Redux code.

# Install

Prerequisites: NodeJS 7.6.0 or later.

Clone this repository then `yarn install` or `npm install`.

# Build

Generate output files in the *dist* directory:
```
npm run build
```

Or to start the webpack development server:
```
npm run serve
```

Then you can open a browser and navigate to *http://localhost:8080/* and watch some of the most interesting photos on Flickr go by in a not very animated manner.
